## Implementation notes

<!--
Call out anything reviewers should know that isn't obvious from the diff.
For example:
- architectural decisions
- authorization/scoping considerations
- migration/backfill behaviour
- performance implications
- compatibility concerns
- intentionally deferred work
-->

### Backend

<!-- Remove if not applicable. -->

* Module(s):
* API / endpoint changes:
* Authorization changes:
* Database/query changes:
* Background-job changes:

### Frontend

<!-- Remove if not applicable. -->

### Database

<!-- Remove if not applicable. -->

* Migration(s):

* Data migration / backfill:
* Rollback considerations:

---

## API / data contract changes

* [ ] No API or data contract changes
* [ ] Existing endpoint/request/response changed
* [ ] New endpoint/request/response added
* [ ] Database schema/constraint changed
* [ ] Frontend/backend contract changed

<!--
If applicable, describe breaking changes, compatibility requirements,
or important request/response changes.
-->

---

## Security & authorization

* [ ] No security-sensitive behaviour changed
* [ ] Authentication behaviour changed
* [ ] Authorization / role checks changed
* [ ] Student ownership/access checks changed
* [ ] Rate limiting / request limits changed
* [ ] Sensitive data handling changed
* [ ] External identity-provider behaviour changed

<!--
If authorization changed, explain which roles can access the new/changed
behaviour and where the server-side enforcement lives.
-->

---

## Testing

### Automated checks

* [ ] `cd backend && go build ./...`
* [ ] `cd backend && go vet ./...`
* [ ] `cd backend && go test ./...`
* [ ] `cd frontend && pnpm lint`
* [ ] `cd frontend && pnpm test`
* [ ] `cd frontend && pnpm build`

<!-- Check only what is relevant. -->

### Additional testing

<!--
Describe manual verification, targeted tests, edge cases, or test data used.
Include commands where useful.
-->

## Database / generated code checklist

* [ ] Ran `sqlc generate` after changing SQL queries or migrations
* [ ] Did not hand-edit `backend/db/sqlc/`
* [ ] Migration has both `up` and `down` paths where appropriate
* [ ] Migration is safe for existing data
* [ ] Data/backfill behaviour has been verified
* [ ] No database changes

---

## Architecture checklist

* [ ] Backend changes follow the module/capability boundaries
* [ ] Module repositories are the only module files importing `db/sqlc`
* [ ] Cross-module dependencies use narrow interfaces / ports where appropriate
* [ ] Frontend feature boundaries are preserved
* [ ] No feature imports another feature's pages or API values
* [ ] Axios usage remains inside `api/` / `shared/api`
* [ ] Shared code has no feature-specific ownership
* [ ] No unnecessary duplication of existing shared UI/components
* [ ] No generated files were manually edited

---

## Documentation

* [ ] Documentation updated
* [ ] ADR needed
* [ ] ADR updated
* [ ] No documentation changes needed

<!--
If this introduces or changes a non-obvious architectural decision,
explain why an ADR is or isn't needed.

## Reviewer notes

<!--
Anything specific you want reviewers to pay attention to?
Examples:
- "Please pay particular attention to authorization for teacher accounts."
- "The migration is intentionally non-reversible."
- "This follows the existing attendance list-page pattern."
